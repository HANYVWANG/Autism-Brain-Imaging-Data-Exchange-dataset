# Autism-Brain-Imaging-Data-Exchange-dataset

The dataset comprises 47 subjects from the YALE study site, part of the ABIDE resting-state fMRI data (http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/abide/quality_assessment.html). 

The 'YALE_fmri' is a list where each element corresponds to a fMRI time series matrix for a single subject. Each matrix has dimensions of 196 Ã— 110, where 196 represents the number of time points in the fMRI data and 110 denotes the number of brain regions. 

The 'YALE_demo_var' is a data frame containing demographic information for the corresponding subjects. Among them, `DX_GROUP` is the Diagnostic Group (1=Autism; 2=Control); `AGE_AT_SCAN` is the Age at time of scan in years; `SEX` is subject gender (1=MALE; 2=Female).
